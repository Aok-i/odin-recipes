This is the first project of the Foundations path in the Odin Project. It will demonstrate the very basics of Html . This includes the staring for an hrml file , opening and closing tags , the use of headings , paragraphs ,lists, bold and italic tages , links and images . The project is focused on recipes , 3 different ones to be exact. 
Reflection : The html concepts were quite easy to grasp and apply when doing the project. It was interesting to see how all the apsects came together to make a webpage that showed a food recipe . There were some terms i needed to revise in order to fully compelte the project but overall the project was smooth sailing , for a noob .
